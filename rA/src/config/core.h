//Comment to disable the official walk path
// -- The official walkpath disables users from taking non-clear walk paths,
// -- e.g. if they want to get around a obstacle they have to walk around it,
// -- while with OFFICIAL_WALKPATH disabled if they click to walk around a obstacle the server will do it automatically

/// leave this line uncommented to enable callfunc checks when processing scripts.
/// while allowed, the script engine will attempt to match user-defined functions
/// in scripts allowing direct function callback (without the use of callfunc.)
/// this CAN affect performance, so if you find scripts running slower or find
/// your map-server using more resources while this is active, comment the line
#define SCRIPT_CALLFUNC_CHECK

//Uncomment to enable the Cell Stack Limit mod.
//It's only config is the battle_config cell_stack_limit.
//Only chars affected are those defined in BL_CHAR (mobs and players currently)
//#define CELL_NOSTACK

//Uncomment to enable circular area checks.
//By default, all range checks in Aegis are of Square shapes, so a weapon range
//  of 10 allows you to attack from anywhere within a 21x21 area.
//Enabling this changes such checks to circular checks, which is more realistic,
//  but is not the official behaviour.
